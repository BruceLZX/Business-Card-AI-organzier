# UI

[中文说明 / Chinese](README.UI.zh.md)

SwiftUI screens and reusable UI modules.

Subfolders:
- `Home/` capture entry and recent documents (long-press delete).
- `Capture/` camera and creation flow (vision-first parse + OCR fallback).
- `Detail/` contact and company detail pages (field-level undo and highlighting).
- `YellowPages/` directory, search, and filters.
- `Settings/` app settings.
- `Components/` shared components.
