# BusinessCardAIAssisstant

[中文说明 / Chinese](README.zh.md)

**An AI-powered business card hub for people who meet a lot of people.**
Capture once, structure forever: contacts, companies, links, tags, and enriched summaries that stay connected.

If your camera roll is full of business card photos and your CRM is empty, this is for you.

## What makes it different
- **Living profiles, not static scans**: contacts and companies stay linked and searchable.
- **Vision-first parsing**: multi-photo capture with OCR fallback for robustness.
- **AI enrichment with accountability**: per-field highlights, original values, and one-tap undo.
- **Language-aware names**: show the right name for the current language with the original as context.

## Product scope
- Capture, create, and edit contact/company documents.
- Cross-link contacts and companies with fast navigation.
- Directory view with search, filters, and alphabetical indexing.
- AI enrichment with staged progress and field-level tracking.

## Docs
- Product requirements (Chinese): `Product Requirement.md`
- Product requirements (English): `Product Requirement.en.md`

## Roadmap (short)
- In-app memory usage display.
- User-managed API keys/models per stage with validation.
- Document sharing with import confirmation and duplicate resolution.
- PDF export per document.
- Paid distribution (no in-app purchase flow).
